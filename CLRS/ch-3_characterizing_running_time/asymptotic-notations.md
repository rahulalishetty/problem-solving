# O-notation $\Omega$-notation $\Theta$-notation

### O-notation

O-notation characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows no faster than a certain rate, based on the highest-order term. Consider, for example, the function 7n^3^ + 100n^2^ - 20n + 6. Its highest order term is 7n^3^ and so we say that this functionâ€™s rate of growth is . Because this function grows no faster than , we can write that it is O(n^3^). You might be surprised that we can also write that the function 7n^3^ + 100n^2^ - 20n + 6 is O(n^4^). Why? Because the function grows more slowly than n^4^, we are correct in saying that it grows no faster. this function is also O(n^5^), O(n^6^), and so on. More generally, it is O(n^c^) for any constant c >= 3.

### $\Omega$-notation

$\Omega$-notation characterizes a lower bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows at least as fast as a certain rate, based as in O-notation on the highest order term. Because the highest-order term in function 7n^3^ + 100n^2^ - 20n + 6 grows atleast as fast as n^3^, this function is $\Omega$(n^2^) and $\Omega$(n). More generally, it is $\Omega$(n^c^) for any constant <= 3.

### $\Theta$-notation

$\Theta$-notation characterizes a tight bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. It says that a function grows precisely at a certain rate, based4once again4on the highest-order term. Put another way, -notation characterizes the rate of growth of the function to within a constant factor from above and to within a constant factor from below. These two constant factors need not be equal.

If you can show a function is both O(f(n)) and $\Theta$(f(n)) for some function f(n), then you have shown that function is $\Theta$(f(n)) For example, since the function 7n^3^ + 100n^2^ - 20n + 6 is both O(n^3^) and $\Omega$(n^3^), it is also $\Theta$(n^3^).
