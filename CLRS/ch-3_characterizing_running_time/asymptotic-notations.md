# O-notation $\Omega$-notation $\Theta$-notation

### O-notation

O-notation characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows no faster than a certain rate, based on the highest-order term. Consider, for example, the function 7n<sup>3</sup> + 100n<sup>2</sup> - 20n + 6. Its highest order term is 7n<sup>3</sup> and so we say that this functionâ€™s rate of growth is . Because this function grows no faster than , we can write that it is O(n<sup>3</sup>). You might be surprised that we can also write that the function 7n<sup>3</sup> + 100n<sup>2</sup> - 20n + 6 is O(n<sup>4</sup>). Why? Because the function grows more slowly than n<sup>4</sup>, we are correct in saying that it grows no faster. this function is also O(n<sup>5</sup>), O(n<sup>6</sup>), and so on. More generally, it is O(n<sup>c</sup>) for any constant c >= 3.

### $\Omega$-notation

$\Omega$-notation characterizes a lower bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. In other words, it says that a function grows at least as fast as a certain rate, based as in O-notation on the highest order term. Because the highest-order term in function 7n<sup>3</sup> + 100n<sup>2</sup> - 20n + 6 grows atleast as fast as n<sup>3</sup>, this function is $\Omega$(n<sup>2</sup>) and $\Omega$(n). More generally, it is $\Omega$(n<sup>c</sup>) for any constant <= 3.

### $\Theta$-notation

$\Theta$-notation characterizes a tight bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function. It says that a function grows precisely at a certain rate, based4once again4on the highest-order term. Put another way, -notation characterizes the rate of growth of the function to within a constant factor from above and to within a constant factor from below. These two constant factors need not be equal.

If you can show a function is both O(f(n)) and $\Theta$(f(n)) for some function f(n), then you have shown that function is $\Theta$(f(n)) For example, since the function 7n<sup>3</sup> + 100n<sup>2</sup> - 20n + 6 is both O(n<sup>3</sup>) and $\Omega$(n<sup>3</sup>), it is also $\Theta$(n<sup>3</sup>).
